## AirBnB clone - Web static

## "Web static" typically refers to the static components of a website. In the context of web development, a "static" website refers to a website that is composed of fixed files that don't change unless manually updated. These files include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets that make up the visual and interactive elements of a webpage.

Static websites are contrasted with dynamic websites, which generate content on the server-side in real-time based on user interactions or other factors. Dynamic websites often use databases, server-side scripting languages (such as PHP, Python, or Ruby), and other technologies to deliver personalized and frequently changing content.

Static websites are simpler to create and host because they don't require complex server-side processing or database interactions. They are often used for smaller websites, blogs, portfolios, landing pages, or any situation where the content doesn't need to be updated frequently. Static websites can be hosted on various platforms and are well-suited for content that doesn't need real-time updates.

## In the context of an "AirBnB clone - Web static," it might refer to creating a static version of a website similar to Airbnb's user interface and design. This could involve using HTML, CSS, and possibly some JavaScript to replicate the look and feel of Airbnb's website, without implementing the full dynamic functionality that Airbnb provides.

## What is HTML:
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. HTML uses a system of tags and elements to define the structure of a webpage's content.

How to create an HTML page:
To create an HTML page, you need to follow these steps:

Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code).
Write your HTML code using the appropriate tags and elements to structure your content.
Save the file with a .html extension, such as index.html.
Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the rendered webpage.

## What is a markup language:
A markup language is a system for annotating text to indicate how it should be structured, formatted, or presented. In the context of the web, HTML is a markup language that is used to define the structure and content of webpages.

## What is the DOM:
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a hierarchical tree of objects, where each object corresponds to an element on the webpage. The DOM allows scripts (such as JavaScript) to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage.

## What is an element / tag:
An element (often referred to as a tag) in HTML is a fundamental building block that represents a structure or content within a webpage. Elements are enclosed within angle brackets (< >) and typically come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between the opening and closing tags defines the purpose and characteristics of the element.

## What is an attribute:
An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element and is specified within the opening tag of the element. Attributes are written as name-value pairs and are used to configure the behavior or appearance of an element. For example, the src attribute in an <img> tag specifies the source URL of an image.

How does the browser load a webpage:
When a browser loads a webpage, it follows these general steps:

The browser sends a request to the web server for the webpage's HTML file.
The web server sends back the HTML file.
The browser parses the HTML code and constructs the DOM.
The browser fetches external resources (e.g., images, stylesheets, scripts) referenced in the HTML.
The browser renders the webpage, applying CSS styles and executing JavaScript code.

## What is CSS:
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the visual presentation of HTML elements. CSS defines how elements should be styled, including properties like colors, fonts, margins, and positioning.

How to add style to an element:
You can add style to an element by using CSS. You can either include inline styles within an element's style attribute, use internal styles by placing <style> tags in the <head> section of the HTML document, or link to an external CSS file using the <link> tag.

What is a class:
A class is a way to define a reusable set of styles that can be applied to multiple elements. Elements with the same class attribute share the specified styles. This allows for consistent styling across different parts of a webpage.

What is a selector:
A selector is a pattern that is used to target HTML elements for styling with CSS. Selectors define which elements should be affected by the styles you apply. They can target elements by their type, class, ID, attributes, and more.

How to compute CSS Specificity Value:
CSS specificity is a way to determine which styles should be applied to an element when conflicting styles are present. Specificity is calculated based on the number of ID, class, and element selectors used. The more specific the selector, the higher its specificity value. You can compute specificity by assigning values to each type of selector and comparing them.

What are Box properties in CSS:
Box properties in CSS control the dimensions and spacing of elements on a webpage. They include properties like width, height, margin, padding, border, and box-sizing. These properties determine how elements are sized, positioned, and spaced within the layout of a webpage. The box-sizing property can be used to control whether an element's dimensions include its padding and border or not.
